# Secure Vibe Coding with AWS MCP Servers & PkgDiet

## Overview
When using agentic AI to build AWS infrastructure (like CDK stacks or Lambda functions), it's highly productive to use the `aws-iac-mcp-server` to let the AI write your CloudFormation or CDK code.

However, AIs often hallucinate or suggest outdated/vulnerable `npm` packages for your Lambda functions (e.g., suggesting `request` or `moment.js`). 

By combining the **AWS IaC MCP Server** with the **PkgDiet MCP Server**, you create a **Secure Vibe Coding** environment. The AI can generate the infrastructure, while PkgDiet acts as a guardrail to ensure only healthy, modern, and secure dependencies are provisioned.

## Local Examples

We have provided local, zero-cost examples in `examples/aws-secure-vibe-coding/`. These examples demonstrate how PkgDiet audits standard Node.js applications without deploying any AWS resources.

### 1. Vulnerable Example
Navigate to `examples/aws-secure-vibe-coding/vulnerable-example`:
```bash
npm ci
npx pkgdiet audit
```
*Notice how PkgDiet flags the outdated packages and suggests modern alternatives.*

### 2. Guarded Example
Navigate to `examples/aws-secure-vibe-coding/guarded-example`:
```bash
npm ci
npx pkgdiet ci
```
*Notice how the CI gate cleanly passes because the dependencies have been modernized.*

## Adding PkgDiet to your AWS Vibe Coding Setup

Add both servers to your `mcp.json` (e.g., in Cursor or Kiro):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aws-iac": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.aws-iac-mcp-server@latest"]
    },
    "pkgdiet": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "pkgdiet@2.0.1", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Now, when you prompt the agent:
> "Write a CDK stack with a Lambda function that fetches data from an API and parses the date."

The agent will use `aws-iac` for the CDK constructs, and `pkgdiet` to check the dependencies before it finalizes the `package.json` for the Lambda function, steering it away from `request` and `moment` towards native `fetch` and `date-fns`!
